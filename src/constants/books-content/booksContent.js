  'Harry Potter': [
    'Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr.Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from hisnephew Harry\'s room.\n"Third time this week!" he roared across the table. "If you can\'t control that owl, it\'ll have to go!"Harry tried, yet again, to explain.\n"She\'s bored," he said. "She\'s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night--""Do I look stupid?" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. "Iknow what\'ll happen if that owl\'s let out."\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\n Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys\' son,Dudley.\n"I want more bacon."\n"There\'s more in the frying pan, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son."We must build you up while we\'ve got the chance... I don\'t like the sound of that school food...""Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings," said Uncle Vernon heartily. "Dudley gets enough, don\'t you, son?"\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turnedto Harry.\n"Pass the frying pan."\n"You\'ve forgotten the magic word," said Harry irritably.',
    'The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.\n"I meant "please"!" said Harry quickly. "I didn\'t mean--"\n"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU," thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, "ABOUT SAYING THE "M" WORD IN OUR HOUSE?"\n"But I--"\n"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.\n"I just--"\n"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!"\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.\n"All right," said Harry, "all right... "\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.'

  'Moon and Sixpence': [
    'The number of times I met Mrs. Strickland in the summer was not too small. From time to time, I go to her house for lunch, or go to a tea party; lunch is always good, and refreshments are very rich. I am very similar to Mrs. Strickland. I was very young at the time. Perhaps she liked the hard way of guiding me to the childish footsteps. In my case, I was happy to find someone to talk about when I encountered some unsatisfactory trivia. I know that she will listen to her, and I will certainly give me some reasonable advice. Mrs. Strickland is very sympathetic. Sympathetic stickers are a rare skill, but they are often abused by those who know they have this skill. When they saw that their friends had any misfortunes, they rushed to people and put all their talents to work. This is terrible. Compassion should be like a well, and the sympathizers make it indulge, but the victims are very embarrassed. Some people have so many tears on their chests, I can\'t bear to sprinkle me again. Mrs. Strickland is very good at using her strengths. She makes you feel that accepting her sympathy is a good thing for her. When I was young, I was talking about this with Rouse Vettefund in a passionate enthusiasm. She said:\n"Milk is delicious, especially with a few drops of brandy. But the cow can\'t wait to get it out. The swollen nipples are very uncomfortable."\nThe mouth of Rouse Vettefund is very mean. No one can say that this kind of spicy thing can\'t be exported, but on the other hand, no one is doing anything beautiful.',
    'One more thing makes me like Mrs. Strickland. Her residence is very elegantly furnished. The room is always clean and the flowers are very comfortable. Although the printed fabric curtains in the living room are relatively old-fashioned, the colors are bright and elegant. Eating in an elegant little restaurant is a pleasure; the dining table is generous, the two maids are clean and the dishes are cooked very delicately. Everyone can see that Mrs. Strickland is a capable housewife. In addition, she is no doubt a good wife and mother. A picture of her children is in the living room. Son - his name is Robert - 16 years old, is studying at Rogbay School; you see him wearing a set of flannel clothes, a cricket hat, and another photo wearing a tuxedo. Attached to an upright hard collar. Like his mother, he has a wide net forehead and beautiful eyes that are contemplative. He looks clean and tidy, looks healthy and correct.\n"I don\'t think he is too smart," one day when I was looking at the photos, Mrs. Strickland said, "But I know he is a good boy. The character is very cute."\nThe daughter is fourteen years old. The hair is the same as the mother, thick and black, and thickly covered on the shoulders. The docile face, the dignified, clear eyes are the same as the mother.'

  'The Shadow Theif': [
    'My childhood was there, with a little sadness and a bit of sorrow. In this small city outside the province, I was desperately waiting for Elizabeth to pity and look at me, waiting to grow up in despair.\n"Look at it, everything will go through..."\nOn the school day, I leaned against a sycamore and looked at the small groups. I didn\'t belong to any one of them. I didn\'t have any smiles, hugs, no signs of joy after a holiday, and no object to tell me about my vacation. life. Those who have turned to school should be familiar with the scene: in the morning of September, parents will assure you that everything will go smoothly, and they will remember the things of the past! And you can only respond with a sore throat. In fact, they all forgot, but this is not their fault, they are just old.\nIn the hall, the bells rang, and the students faced the teacher in several columns, listening to the teacher a little. There are three people wearing glasses, and the number is not large. I was assigned to the sixth grade C class, and once again became the youngest person in the class; I was unlucky, born in December, although my parents were very happy that I had read it for six months, they were proud of it, every time. I was annoyed at the beginning of school.',
    'Being the youngest person in the class means wiping the blackboard, collecting chalk, collecting the sports blanket of the gymnasium, and placing the basketball on a high rack. To make matters worse, you have to sit alone in the first row when you shoot the whole class group; in school, there is no more shameful than this.\nBut this is nothing at all, because the sixth grade C class also has a bully named Mag, which is also my biggest enemy.\nIf I counted reading for a few months (thanks to my parents), Mag is enrolled two years late. His parents completely ignored his life and death, as long as the school took over their son, let him eat lunch at the student restaurant, and then go home in the evening, they are satisfied.\nI wear glasses, but Magma has eagle-like eyes. Compared with boys of the same age, my vision is about ten centimeters weaker, and Magma is just ten centimeters more. This difference creates a recognized gap between me and him. I hate basketball. Magg only knows how to shoot. I love to read poetry. He loves sports. Although the two are not tolerant, they are almost the same. I love to observe the cockroaches on the trunk, but he loves to catch them and break the wings.'

  'The Kite Runner': [
    'I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975. I remember the precise moment, crouching behind a crumbling mud wall, peeking into the alley near the frozen creek. That was a long time ago, but it\'s wrong what they say about the past, I\'ve learned, about how you can bury it. Because the past claws its way out. Looking back now, I realize I have been peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty-six years.\nOne day last summer, my friend Rahim Khan called from Pakistan. He asked me to come see him. Standing in the kitchen with the receiver to my ear, I knew it wasn\'t just Rahim Khan on the line. It was my past of unatoned sins. After I hung up, I went for a walk along Spreckels Lake on the northern edge of Golden Gate Park. The early-afternoon sun sparkled on the water where dozens of miniature boats sailed, propelled by a crisp breeze. Then I glanced up and saw a pair of kites, red with long blue tails, soaring in the sky. They danced high above the trees on the west end of the park, over the windmills, floating side by side like a pair of eyes looking down on San Francisco, the city I now call Home. And suddenly Hassan\'s voice whispered in my head: _For you, a thousand times over_. Hassan the harelipped kite runner.\nI sat on a park bench near a willow tree. I thought about something Rahim Khan said just before he hung up, almost as an after thought. _There is a way to be good again_. I looked up at those twin kites. I thought about Hassan. Thought about Baba. Ali. Kabul. I thought of the life I had lived until the winter of 1975 came and changed everything. And made me what I am today.',
    'When we were children, Hassan and I used to climb the poplar trees in the driveway of my father\'s house and annoy our neighbors by reflecting sunlight into their Homes with a shard of mirror. We would sit across from each other on a pair of high branches, our naked feet dangling, our trouser pockets filled with dried mulberries and walnuts. We took turns with the mirror as we ate mulberries, pelted each other with them, giggling, laughing; I can still see Hassan up on that tree, sunlight flickering through the leaves on his almost perfectly round face, a face like a Chinese doll chiseled from hardwood: his flat, broad nose and slanting, narrow eyes like bamboo leaves, eyes that looked, depending on the light, gold, green, even sapphire I can still see his tiny low-set ears and that pointed stub of a chin, a meaty appendage that looked like it was added as a mere afterthought. And the cleft lip, just left of midline, where the Chinese doll maker\'s instrument may have slipped; or perhaps he had simply grown tired and careless.\nSometimes, up in those trees, I talked Hassan into firing walnuts with his slingshot at the neighbor\'s one-eyed German shepherd. Hassan never wanted to, but if I asked, _really_ asked, he wouldn\'t deny me. Hassan never denied me anything. And he was deadly with his slingshot. Hassan\'s father, Ali, used to catch us and get mad, or as mad as someone as gentle as Ali could ever get. He would wag his finger and wave us down from the tree. He would take the mirror and tell us what his mother had told him, that the devil shone mirrors too, shone them to distract Muslims during prayer. "And he laughs while he does it,?he always added, scowling at his son.\n"Yes, Father,?Hassan would mumble, looking down at his feet. But he never told on me. Never told that the mirror, like shooting walnuts at the neighbor\'s dog, was always my idea.'

  'Catcher in the Rye': [
    'If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you\'ll probably want to know is where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don\'t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They\'re quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They\'re nice and all--I\'m not saying that--but they\'re also touchy as hell. Besides, I\'m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I\'ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean that\'s all I told D.B. about, and he\'s my brother and all. He\'s in Hollywood. That isn\'t too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every weekend. He\'s going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He\'s got a lot of dough, now. He didn\'t use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was "The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that wouldn\'t let anybody look at his goldfish because he\'d bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he\'s out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there\'s one thing I hate, it\'s the movies. Don\'t even mention them to me.',
    'Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this school that\'s in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You\'ve probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse\'s picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don\'t do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn\'t know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way. \nAnyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn\'t win. I remember around three o\'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn\'t see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.

  'Twilight': [
    'My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. \nIn the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I\'d been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. It was to Forks that I now exiled myself— an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. \nI loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. ',
    '"Bella," my mom said to me — the last of a thousand times — before I got on the plane. "You don\'t have to do this." \nMy mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still… \n"I want to go," I lied. I\'d always been a bad liar, but I\'d been saying \nthis lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \n"Tell Charlie I said hi." \n"I will." \n"I\'ll see you soon," she insisted. "You can come home whenever you want — \nI\'ll come right back as soon as you need me." \nBut I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise. \n"Don\'t worry about me," I urged. "It\'ll be great. I love you, Mom." \nShe hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. '

  'The Great Gatsby': [
    'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. \n‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.’\n He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. ',
    ' Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.'

  'Fifty Shades Of Grey': [
    'I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror. Damn my hair – it just won’t beha一ve, and damn Katherine Ka一vanagh for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal. I should be studying for my final exams, which are next week, yet here I am trying to brush my hair into submission. I must not sleep with it wet. I must not sleep with it wet. Reciting this mantra several times, I attempt, once more, to bring it under control with the brush. I roll my eyes in exasperation and gaze at the pale, brown-haired girl with blue eyes too big for her face staring back at me, and give up. My only option is to restrain my wayward hair in a ponytail and hope that I look semi presentable.',
    'Kate is my roommate, and she has chosen today of all days to succumb to the flu. Therefore, she cannot attend the interview she’d arranged to do, with some mega-industrialist tycoon I’ve never heard of, for the student newspaper. So I ha一ve been volunteered. I ha一ve final exams to cram for, one essay to finish, and I’m supposed to be working this afternoon, but no – today I ha一ve to drive a hundred and sixty-five miles to downtown Seattle in order to meet the enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. As an exceptional entrepreneur and major benefactor of our University, his time is extraordinarily precious – much more precious than mine – but he has granted Kate an interview. A real coup, she tells me. Damn her extra-curricular activities.'
